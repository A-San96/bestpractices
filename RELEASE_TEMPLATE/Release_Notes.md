Best Practices for writing release notes:
1. Use plain language - Leave the techno-jargon out
2. Keep them short - Donâ€™t turn release notes into a novel
3. Group them logically - FIXES, IMPROVEMENTS, NEW FEATURES, etc
4. Include relevant links - Provide more info like a user guide or a video tutorial
